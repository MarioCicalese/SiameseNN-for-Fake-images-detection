# 🔍 DeepFake Image Detection with Siamese Neural Networks

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project was to develop a **Siamese Neural Network** capable of performing **binary classification** based on the **Euclidean distance between embedding vectors** generated by the network. This classification helps in predicting whether an image is **synthetic or real**. The model was trained using **RGB images of size 200x200**, which were converted into the **frequency domain using the Fourier Transform**. These images were sourced from the [ArtiFact dataset](https://github.com/awsaf49/artifact), which contains a total of 2,496,738 images, including 964,989 real and 1,531,749 synthetic images.
The frequency domain was chosen because prior research has indicated that **generative models leave artificial imprints**, often referred to as **'fingerprints'**, on the images they generate. **These fingerprints can be leveraged to detect synthetic images**. However, these **fingerprints are not visible in the RGB spatial domain** but can be observed in the frequency domain.

## 🗃️ ArtiFact Dataset
The images used to train the model were sourced from the **[Artifact Dataset](https://github.com/awsaf49/artifact)**, which comprises a total of **2,496,738 RGB images of size 200×200**, including **964,989 real** and **1,531,749 synthetic samples**. The images span **various domains** such as human faces, animals, landscapes, vehicles, and artworks. The synthetic images were generated using **25 different models**, specifically **13 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, **7 Diffusion models**, and **5 other generation techniques.**

## 🛠️ Installation Instructions
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

1. **Cloning the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd SiameseNN-for-Fake-images-detection

2. **Setting Up the Environment:**
    - **Using Conda**
        If you are using Conda, you can create a new environment and install all the required dependencies as follows:
        ```bash
        conda create --name myenv python=3.10
        conda activate myenv

    - **Using Python venv**
        If you prefer using venv, you can set up your environment like this:
        ```bash
        python -m venv myenv

        # On Windows:
        myenv\Scripts\activate

        # On Unix or MacOS:
        source myenv/bin/activate

3. **Installing the required Python packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

## 🚀 Running the Application
Once the environment is set up and activated, you can run the main script from the terminal:
```bash
cd ModelTesting
python main.py
```
This script will execute the testing phase of the Siamese Neural Network using the trained model in the project's files.
